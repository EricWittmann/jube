## Web Console

The Web Console is based on the [hawtio project](http://hawt.io/) and provides a rich HTML5 based web application for working with Kubernetes and the underlying containers reusing the various [hawtio plugins](http://hawt.io/plugins/index.html).

If you are running Jube then the web console should be visible at [http://localhost:8585/hawtio/](http://localhost:8585/hawtio/). You can then view these tabs:

 * [Pods tab](http://localhost:8585/hawtio/kubernetes/pods) views all the available [pods](pods.html) in your kubernetes environment
 * [Replication Controllers tab](http://localhost:8585/hawtio/kubernetes/replicationControllers) views all the available [replication controllers](replicationControllers.html) in your kubernetes environment
 * [Services tab](http://localhost:8585/hawtio/kubernetes/services) views all the available [services](services.html) in your kubernetes environment
